# Robotic Navigation and Task Execution Simulator

## Overview
This project provides a simulation environment for robotic navigation and task management. It includes capabilities for defining environments, simulating robot behavior, and executing complex tasks through high-level commands.

## Components

### `navigate.py`
- **Purpose**: Handles the navigation logic for a robot, including path planning and movement.
- **Key Features**:
  - Path finding algorithms
  - Movement execution functions

### `simulator.py`
- **Purpose**: Manages the simulation environment where the robot operates.
- **Key Features**:
  - Environment setup (e.g., maps, obstacles)
  - Simulation of dynamic changes in the environment
  - State management

### Top-level Execution Scripts
- **`toplevel.py`**: Manages the execution of basic navigational tasks.
- **`toplevel_task2.py`** and **`toplevel3.py`**: Handle more complex scenarios or different sets of tasks.

## Usage
1. Setup your simulation environment using `simulator.py`.
2. Define tasks and navigation routes in the top-level scripts.
3. Run the appropriate top-level script to start the simulation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Additional Python packages: (list any required packages, e.g., `numpy`, `matplotlib` for visualization)

## Getting Started
1. Configure your environment and robot settings in `simulator.py`.
2. Modify tasks and parameters in the top-level scripts as needed.
3. Execute the simulation: `python toplevel.py`
